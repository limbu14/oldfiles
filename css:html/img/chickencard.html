            more than 70 per cent of all bird species - <br>
            over 5000 species altogether - are <br>
            Perching birds or passerines, for example <br>
            sparrows and starlings, and this song <br>
            thrush shown here. They have feet with <br>
            three toes pointing fowards and one <br>
            backwards, to help them cling to a perch. <br>
            Most build small, neat cup-shaped nests <br>
            and they sing a sequence of musical notes.
